## 🕹️ How to Play (Desktop)

Once opened in a desktop browser:

### 1️⃣ Start the Game

Click the **START GAME** button in the center of the screen.

### 2️⃣ Movement & Actions

Use the keyboard to control the ship (triangle):

| Action        | Key           | Description                                        |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Thrust / Move | ↑ Up Arrow    | Pushes the ship forward (momentum-based movement). |
| Rotate Left   | ← Left Arrow  | Rotate counter-clockwise.                          |
| Rotate Right  | → Right Arrow | Rotate clockwise.                                  |
| Shoot         | SPACE         | Fire bullets to break asteroids.                   |

### 3️⃣ Objective

🔥 Destroy **green squares** to break them into smaller pieces
💥 Avoid collisions—touching them costs a life
🌍 Wrap-around movement — leaving one side reappears on another

Use space, movement physics, and wrap-around to survive!
